      <div>We all tend to lose track of our initial goal when we go into social media. Sometimes we blame our persistence to it, without knowing that all we need is actually a few seconds to contemplate our goals before using it. 
</div>

<div>You can think of this few seconds as the time to stop wrong intention and think about your real purpose; 
or you can think of them as a chance for you to have a wider picture: do I want a morning of illusionary happiness or do I want a productive whole day? 
</div>

<p id="new">
<div>This is where our app Wait! will come in for you! </div>
<div>It is designed to be bound with  social media apps like Wechat, Instagram, Facebook, etc. Every time you click into socil media app, a notification surface will pop up, asking you to wait a few seconds and think about  what  you want to do with the app this time. A quick single click only allows a single interface. If you want to switch surface,  just choose again. Daily, weekly, monthly summaries are available for comparisons of usage.
